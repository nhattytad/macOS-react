## Short Description
A MacOS Clone built with React. Imitates the usual desktop features, wallpaper settings, system settings, an integrated weather app (and more to come). Detailed feature-list can be found below.

## Motivation
My initial motivation in building this was honestly not to build it at all. Because as you can see by this project's folder structure, it was in fact not supposed to be a mac os clone but just a simple weather app when I was starting out. I was trying to revisit API usage to get muscle memory and a better understanding of working with APIs in general down but ended up being a bit bored and built a MacOS around it.

## ü§ù Contributions
This project is open to contributions! I am still working on some features (Calculator, Calendar, VSCode, Music App) and there's probably a ton of things to add/change/fix. Feel free to fork it and create a PR!

## Credits
[PuruVJ](https://github.com/PuruVJ): I built this clone entirely inspired by this MacOS Clone in Svelte, although I reverse-engineered it, meaning I didn't re-use anything from the project.
