## Short Description
A MacOS Clone built with React. Imitates the usual desktop features, wallpaper settings, system settings, an integrated weather app (and more to come). Detailed feature-list can be found below.

## Motivation
My initial motivation in building this was honestly not to build it at all. Because as you can see by this project's folder structure, it was infact not supposed to be a mac os clone but just a simple weather app when I was starting out. I was trying to revisit API usage to get muscle memory and a better understanding of working with APIs in general down but ended up being a bit bored and built a MacOS around it.

## Features
- Expressive, responsive and clear UI/UX
- Extensive unit and integration tests to ensure intentional behaviour
- Search any game you want
- Filters to sort after genres and ratings
- Like & Wishlist feature to track your personal wishlist
- Smooth Animations with Framer Motion
- Quick Navigation to view all parts of the project without having to click through it

## Stack
- Framework: React
- Language: TypeScript
- Motion Library: Framer Motion
- Component Library: none
- Stylesheet: SCSS


## What I learned:
- Using motion libraries (e.g. Framer Motion) to achieve much smoother user experiences while maintaining clean code
- Working with a CDN (Cloud Delivery Network) to improve performance by accelerating bundle delivery
- organizing and connecting a project with React Router Dom
